# Tic-Tac-Toe-

This project is based on the common real world game of 
Tic-Tac-Toe and implementing it using Logic Gates. 
Implementing the features of the game using basic logic gates 
gives us a practical understand of how these common gates we 
learn about can be used to bring to life a well-known game in 
the world. This project determines to inspire readers to bridge 
their knowledge of logic gates to the real world applications. 
Taking help from the git hub repo, “Logical-Networks-Tic
Tac-Toe” by Ivan Alberico, we created our own real-life 
version of it using breadboards and beginner components. It 
can be used as a stepping foundation to look forward into the 
vast world of circuits in the world.
